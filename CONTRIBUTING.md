# Contributing
Thank you for thinking about contributing to this project. This document will help you to get started.

## Adding a feature
If you'd like to add a feature to Avatar (or modify its existing behaviour), please start by [creating an issue][create_issue] so we can discuss it.
Don't go straight to a pull request in case it's something I don't wish to accept; I don't want to waste your time.

## Fixing a bug
If you've found a bug, please start by [creating an issue][create_issue]. If you'd like to [make a pull request][create_pr] for the fix once I've confirmed it's a bug in Avatar, that would be great.
